## About

This React app was born out of another financial analysis suite I was building. Since this is only a demo, I tried to keep the functionalities and UI very simple

You can enter any optionable stock symbol (ex. aapl) and look up the option chains on that stock.

There are two parts to this app:
- This repo hosts the client application only
- You can find the server application [here](https://github.com/melissakw)


## Important Notes

- Option chain tables include contracts available within one year only

- All information presented here is for educational purpose only and should not be considered error free or relied upon for investing decisions.
